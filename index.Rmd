I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Statistics at Indiana University. 
My advisors are [Michael Trosset](https://mtrosset.pages.iu.edu/) and [Minh Tang](https://minh-tang.github.io/). 

My research involves statistical inference on graphs and networks, particularly in the context of clustering and community detection.
